          <h3><a href="https://github.com/Cooper-HA/Wordpress" target="_blank">Capstone Front End</a></h3>
          <p>The WordPress Capstone Front End project shows my ability to build a clean, fully functional website using WordPress. I set up WordPress, customized a theme to match the design goals, and developed custom plugins to extend functionality. Emphasis was placed on user-friendliness, responsive design, and cross-browser compatibility. The project reflects strong front-end skills and WordPress development understanding, including plugin creation and theme adaptation.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/Cooper-HA/.NetAPI" target="_blank">Capstone Back End</a></h3>
          <p>​For my Capstone Back End project, I developed a RESTful API using ASP.NET Core to support the front-end of my WordPress site. This back-end system enables dynamic content management and user interactions by facilitating seamless data exchange between the front-end and the server. I utilized Entity Framework Core for efficient database operations, ensuring both data integrity and performance. To validate the API's functionality and reliability, I conducted thorough testing using tools like Postman. This project showcases my proficiency in back-end development and my ability to create scalable, maintainable systems that enhance user experience.</p>

          <h3><a href="https://github.com/Cooper-HA/ServiceNow" target="_blank">ServiceNow Application</a></h3>
          <p>​For my ServiceNow Application project, I set out to build a standalone application entirely within the ServiceNow platform to deepen my understanding of its development tools and capabilities. Using ServiceNow's Studio, I designed and implemented custom tables, forms, and workflows tailored to the application's specific requirements. I incorporated server-side scripting to handle business logic and client-side scripting to enhance user interactions, ensuring a seamless user experience. Throughout the development process, I conducted thorough testing to validate the application's functionality and performance within the ServiceNow environment. This project not only reinforced my proficiency in ServiceNow's development environment but also showcased my ability to create efficient, user-centric applications that leverage the platform's native features.</p>

          <p>​For my Client-Side Programming class final project, I developed an interactive quiz application using React.js and JavaScript. The primary objective was to create a responsive and dynamic web application that adapts seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes. The application allows for access to quizzes through groups and accounts, allowing users to test their knowledge on various topics. Each question is displayed with a set of possible answers or a text field. The application tracks the user's score throughout the quiz and provides a summary at the end. I employed React components and state management to handle dynamic content and user interactions. Additionally, I integrated JavaScript functionalities to manage user inputs, events, and data manipulation within the application. Throughout the development process, I conducted thorough testing and debugging to ensure the application's stability and performance. This project not only met all specified requirements but also reinforced my skills in building user-centric web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/Cooper-HA/Cooper-HA.github.io" target="_blank">GitHub Pages Site</a></h3>
        <p>​For my GitHub Pages Portfolio project, I created a personal website hosted on GitHub Pages to showcase my development work and projects. This portfolio serves as a central hub for potential employers and collaborators to explore my skills, experience, and the technologies I work with. The site is built using HTML and CSS, ensuring responsiveness and accessibility. By leveraging GitHub Pages, I was able to deploy the site directly from my GitHub repository, streamlining the development and hosting process. This project highlights my ability to design and implement a professional online presence that effectively communicates my capabilities and achievements.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/Cooper-HA/System-Analysis-and-Design" target="_blank">System Analysis and Design</a></h3>
        <p>​For my System Analysis and Design project at Helena College, I collaborated with a team to optimize the judge assignment process for Montana Speech and Debate tournaments. The existing system, Tabroom, was complex and unreliable during large events, necessitating manual scheduling and judge assignments. Our analysis identified key areas for improvement, leading to the proposal of two third-party solutions: SpeechWire, offering tournament management tools with limited offline capabilities, and ArbiterSports Scheduling, a comprehensive scheduling system with mobile access and real-time updates. Additionally, we designed a mock-up system tailored to Montana's unique needs, featuring automated judge assignments, centralized event information, and real-time updates for organizers, coaches, judges, and students. This project demonstrated my ability to analyze existing systems, identify user needs, and design effective solutions to enhance operational efficiency.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/Cooper-HA/Python-Project" target="_blank">Python Project</a></h3>
        <p>For my Python Project, I developed a versatile command-line personal assistant named Jarvis. Inspired by the character from Iron Man this application integrates various functionalities to assist users in daily tasks. Key features include:​
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Voice Interaction:</strong> Utilizes the <code>speech_recognition</code> library to process voice commands, enabling hands-free operation.</li>
            <li><strong>Text-to-Speech:</strong> Employs <code>pyttsx3</code> to provide auditory feedback and responses.</li>
            <li><strong>Email Management:</strong> Integrates with SMTP to send emails, supporting attachments and MIME formatting.</li>
            <li><strong>Web Interaction:</strong> Uses <code>webbrowser</code> for opening URLs and <code>requests</code> with <code>BeautifulSoup</code> for web scraping tasks.</li>
            <li><strong>Multimedia Playback:</strong> Incorporates <code>pygame.mixer</code> for audio playback and <code>cv2</code> for video playback.</li>
            <li><strong>Hardware Integration:</strong> Supports Raspberry Pi GPIO for hardware control, including an LCD display and RFID reader.</li>
            <li><strong>Sensor Integration:</strong> Works with DHT11 sensors for environmental monitoring.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          This project demonstrates my ability to integrate various Python libraries and hardware components to create a multifunctional assistant application and it also showcases my problem solving ability.

        <h3><a href="https://github.com/Cooper-HA/Java-Project" target="_blank">Java Project</a></h3>
        <p>For my Java project, I developed a comprehensive restaurant management system utilizing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. This application efficiently handles orders, recipes, and ingredients, streamlining restaurant operations. The system features a public-facing interface for customers to browse the menu and place orders, while also providing a login interface for employees to manage orders, update recipes, and monitor ingredient inventory. By employing the MVC pattern, the application ensures a clean separation of concerns, enhancing maintainability and scalability. This project demonstrates my proficiency in Java programming and my ability to design and implement a functional application using the MVC design pattern.
